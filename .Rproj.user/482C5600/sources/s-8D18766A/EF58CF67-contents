###The climate paradox: mapping resilience and vulnerability of montane forests

Trees can adjust to natural climate fluctuations by efficiently regulating leaf carbon and water exchange; however, the rapid pace of human induced climatic change threatens the ability of forests to sequester carbon and resist draught. While these limits are often characterized at the scale of an individual tree, or a plot, this research seeks to characterize regional scale drivers of forest productivity across the state of Oregon over recent decades. Recent research has found the most stressed forest ecosystems are mixed conifer forests where drought induced mortality has led to massive dieoffs (1). However, at high elevations in these same forests, tree lines are expanding, with longer growing seasons aiding forest expansion (2, 3). This project seeks to develop of a risk index for dieoff of different regions based on characterizations of the impact of shifting climate. By measuring plant, site, and regional scale factors controlling productivity over time we will combine spatial and temporal data, generating a series of maps to inform land management, educate the general public, and direct future scientific efforts. To understand the range of impact of climate change, we identified regions in Oregon (Figure 1, attached) which are experiencing a variety of changes in climate. In the Northeast, the Wallowa mountains show increased moisture, while many Western locations are increasingly dry. By identifying factors which link spatial scales, we will also develop a tool to aid future efforts to model the impact of climate change and disturbance on forest evolution, and natural resources.
