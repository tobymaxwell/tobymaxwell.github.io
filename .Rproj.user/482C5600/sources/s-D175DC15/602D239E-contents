I am a biogeochemist managing the [Soil Plant Atmosphere Lab](https://www.soilplantatmosphere.com) in the department of Ecology and Evolution at University of Oregon.  
&nbsp;  
I am a post doctoral scholar studying resiliance and vulnerability from the tree to landscape scale in mountain forests.  
&nbsp;  
My work seeks to evaluate the impacts of climate change across the landscape by merging classical metrics of soil quality and fertility, with trait based and physiological indicators of plant respones to stress. Site level data is then used in combination with remotely sensed and modeled data to connect what is known about local processes better landscape responses.
