###Sample preparation
A very small amount (2-10 mg) of a sample will be used for total carbon and nitrogen analysis. As a result, samples must be well homogenized. Depending on the amount of sample you have this can be done in a number of ways. After drying you can

1. Mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen
2. Grind in a coffee grinder
3. Powder in a ball mill

If the first two are your option, then you may want to pass the sample through a #40 sieve (425 micron) to assure consistent measurements.

After grinding samples then need to be packaged into tin capsules and weighed on a micro balance to 0.001 mg accuracy.

A note at this point, if you are measuring soils with carbonates present this will interfere with the analysis. You need to follow a separate procedure, detailed in the [attached article by Harris et al.](files/carbonatesoils.pdf)

###Elemental Analysis
Perhaps the most common analyzer is the Costech ECS 4010. This robust instrument combusts the tin capsule in a high oxygen environment at 1020&deg;C. This causes the tin to combust, raising the sample temperature to about 1800C. In theory this rapid and high energy conversion quantitatively converts the material into gas, carbon is then completely oxidized by a chromium oxide catalyst, and nitrogen is left as N2 with and excess oxygen removed by reduced copper wires. Water is removed with magnesium perchlorate, and the gasses separated by a chromatographic column, and measured by a [thermal conductivity detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity_detector). More information on the specifics of running a costech are available online, one good source is [here](https://lter.kbs.msu.edu/protocols/148).
