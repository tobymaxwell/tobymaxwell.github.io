I specialize in applying methods from my background in analytical chemistry in coordination with statistical models and geospatial analysis to connect site level information with remotely sensed and modeled data. By doing so, my research connects site level phenomena to landscape scale processes to better understand drivers of ecological patterns and how they are shifting with climate change across scales.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allign = \"center\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDVFHbUV7z4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nMe in my ideal setting, thinking about science in the middle of the grand canyon!\n",
