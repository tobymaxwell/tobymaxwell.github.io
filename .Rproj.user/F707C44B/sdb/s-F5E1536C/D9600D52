I specialize in applying statistical models and geospatial analysis to connect site level information with remotely sensed and modeled data. By doing so my research seeks to connect site level phenomena to landscape scale processes to better understand drivers of ecological processes and how they are shifting with climate change across scales.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allign = \"center\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDVFHbUV7z4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\nMe in my ideal setting, thinking about science in the middle of the grand canyon!\n",
