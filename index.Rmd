I am an ecosystem biogeochemist working at Boise State University. Currently a post doctoral scholar, my work seeks to evaluate the impacts of climate change across the landscape by merging soil science with plant ecophysiology. My research connects above and below ground drivers and responses to climate change to study nutrient and water cycling across rangeland ecosystems. I specialize in applying methods from my background in biogeochemistry in coordination with statistical models and geospatial analysis to connect site level information with remotely sensed and modeled data. By doing so, my research connects site level phenomena to landscape scale processes to better understand how ecosystems of the great basin resist exotic plant invasions and how these characteristics will respond to climate change across scales.

Me in my ideal setting, thinking about science in the middle of the grand canyon!
