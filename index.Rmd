I am an ecosystem biogeochemist working at Boise State University. My work seeks to evaluate the impacts of climate change on rangelands by merging soil science with plant ecophysiology. My research seeks to improve management and understanding of exotic plant invasions in the Great Basin by leveraging soil-plant interactions to promote resistance to invasion and resilience to disturbances such as wildfire, grazing, and climate change. I specialize in applying methods from my background in soil biogeochemistry in coordination with statistical models and geospatial analysis to connect site level information with remotely sensed and modeled data.
