I am an ecosystem biogeochemist and assistant research professor working at Boise State University in Boise, ID. My work quantifies the impacts of climate change on rangelands by merging soil science with plant ecophysiology. My research focuses on improving management and understanding of exotic plant invasions in the Great Basin by leveraging soil-plant interactions to promote resistance to invasion and resilience to disturbances such as wildfire, grazing, and climate change. Additionally, my research seeks to assess the impact of exotic plant invasions and wildfire on soil carbon storage across the Great Basin. It is my hope that soil carbon sequestration and stabilization can be incorporated as metrics of success for rangeland restoration and stabilization after wildfires and thus my work also focuses on developing new management strategies and that can improve resistance to exotic invaders and resilience of native vegetation, and simultaneously enhance (or maintain) ecosystem carbon stocks. I specialize in applying methods from my background in soil biogeochemistry and plant ecology in coordination with statistical models and geospatial analysis to connect site level information with remotely sensed and modeled data.
