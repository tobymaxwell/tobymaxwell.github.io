Widespread invasion by exotic plants is a fundamental threat to the ecosystem functions provided by semiarid rangelands. While invasive species may occur as a dominant monoculture, many plant communities are affected by a diverse array of exotic plants across functional groups, which may differ in the ways in which they alter the soil environment, leaving behind “legacies” in soil environments that persist beyond these species’ removal in restoration efforts. Yet, the diversity of these invaders is rarely considered in the deployment of restoration efforts. We hypothesize that diversely invaded sites (i.e., containing high diversity of exotic species) may be impacted by a greater number of possible soil legacies that encourage these communities to return to a degraded, invaded state, exhibiting high “resilience” to our restoration efforts. To address this knowledge gap, we will employ an integrative field experiment to quantify restoration success across a gradient of invasive plant diversity, monitor the soil legacies left by pre-restoration invaders (including nitrogen and water cycling), and test possible management solutions to limit invaders’ legacy effects on soil health. The proposed work will: 1) explore how the composition of invaded communities influences the severity and diversity of legacies left by invasive species on soil conditions; 2) advance understanding of how these legacies influence whether communities are reinvaded; and 3) test a series of promising soil nitrogen and water management strategies to promote both healthy soils and recovery of native species, with clear application to ongoing restoration efforts across the Great Basin region.

I am the lead senior personnel for the Boise arm of an NSF funded collaborative project studying genotype X environment interactions of Bromus tectorum L. (Cheatgrass) in rangelands across the Western United States. This project seeks to provide tools for land managers to adapt to the impacts of climate change on Cheatgrass growth and spread. The project will assess the role of sub-specific adaptation of cheatgrass plants in determining survival, fecundity, demography, and phenology using a common garden approach with overlayed climate manipulations across multiple sites. I played a significant role in establishing the experimental design, developed a new method for climate manipulations in the field, generated monitoring protocols for cheatgrass demographics and phenology, installed the experiment, and will soon submit a paper presenting data from a pilot study to establish the methodology. In addition, I am coordinating an effort to measure leaf relevant traits for a subset of plants across the common gardens. Together these data will improve our empirical understanding of cheatgrass survival, growth, and reproduction under current and projected climate conditions across Great Basin and Shortgrass Steppe rangelands, improving forecasting of cheatgrass spread, which will inform land managers of expected shifts in landscape scale resistance to cheatgrass invasion.

The project will assess plant and soil community sensitivity to experimentally imposed drought across a 520 km latitudinal gradient in the PNW. A broad climatic gradient will be used to study typical prairie and pasture systems where increasingly severe seasonal differences, characterized by wetter winters and drier summers, have caused declines in productivity. General hypotheses pertaining to the role of fungal networks in maintaining diverse prairie and low-diversity pasture productivity will be tested to address a major challenge for sustainability in the region and in similar systems elsewhere. Specifically, the proposed tasks will identify plant and fungal species that best maintain primary productivity, plant water-use efficiency, and foster C and N exchange in communities under stress. This knowledge will be used to quantify thresholds of species composition and soil resource availability beyond which intervention is needed to prevent loss of biodiversity and resilience to drought. Alterations of mycorrhizal mediated transfer or retention of C and N will be monitored using pulse stable isotope labeling experiments to determine whether and how inter-specific connectivity increases community resilience and productivity under imposed stress. A replicated nested design across a latitudinal gradient will be used to characterize mycorrhizal network behaviors that can be simplified to improve inter-specific connectivity and resource transfer in native and managed systems. Passive and active resource transport among different plant species and fungi will be distinguished through stable isotope probing of DNA sequences and used to develop a spatially-explicit mechanistic model for the scaling of local mutualistic and competitive interactions affecting composition and function of common mycorrhizal networks.
